# Assignment-3
This Assignment is the Semester 2 Object Oriented Programming Assignment

For this Assignment I was struggling to figure out what it should be based on since the choise was endless.  
Beginning this assignment I wanted to create a solar system which would replicate the speeds and distance from the sun each planet is.  
Then I decided I wanted to create a Pacman game which would demonstrate my knowledge on collision and classes.  
How I figured this game would be too time consuming and would not be demonstrating new found knowledge.  

So I decided to go with the well known game Flappy Bird with my own twists on it.
This game when finished will be available to work on android devices which will show how much extra work and learning I had to do for this assignment.


What I learned:
-@Override: This overrides the functionality of the specified method  
-?: This is a conditional operator  
-Private: This means it can only be accessed by instances of the same object class  
-Canvas: Java object which allows me to draw to the game window  
-JFrame: creates the game window  
-KeyListener: this is a built-in interface for users input
