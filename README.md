# Assignment-3
This Assignment is the Semester 2 Object Oriented Programming Assignment

For this Assignment I was struggling to figure out what it should be based on since the choice was endless.  
Beginning this assignment I wanted to create a solar system which would replicate the speeds and distance from the sun each planet is.  
Then I decided I wanted to create a Pacman game which would demonstrate my knowledge on collision and classes.  
However I figured this game would be too time consuming and would not be demonstrating new found knowledge.  

So I decided to go with the well known game Flappy Bird with my own twists on it.
This game when finished will be available to work on android devices which will show how much extra work and learning I had to do for this assignment.


What I learned from this assignment:
-@Override: This overrides the functionality of the specified method  
-?: This is a conditional operator  
-Private: This means it can only be accessed by instances of the same object class  
-Canvas: Java object which allows me to draw to the game window  
-JFrame: creates the game window  
-KeyListener: this is a built-in interface for users input  

Parts of Assignment which I found difficult:  
-I found learning how to set the background image to be particularly difficult.  
 In Java, There is not one set way to do this as it is not built-in.  
 I was unable to add an image as it seemed to always give me compiler issues and errors.  

What we learned this semester:  
-Use of variables, loops, nested loops and statements  
-Use of methods  
-Iterating over arrays  
-The difference between arrays and arraylists  
-Map method  
-Loading data   
-The use of git for cloning, push and pull  
-Making classes  
-Creating instances of classes  
-The use of polymorphism  
-Constructor methods  

What I implemented into this assignment:  
-Use of variables, loops, nested loops and statements  
 This was implemented thorughout this project as they   
 are the bare essentials for all programs  
-Use of methods   
 I not only used for the genereal use i.e. main(), I   
 also used them universally as in had the same method names for each class for ease  
-Iterating over arrays   
 Arrays are seen all over this prgram as they are mainly   
 used to ensure smooth running of the game i.e. update and render  
-The use of git for cloning, push and pull    
 I used git as it proved to be very beneficial when reviewing   
 code and for copying code from a previous save if I ended up crashing my code  
-Making classes   
 Classes are also used throughout to seperate some methods to make the   
 game more universal  
-Creating instances of classes    
 Instances of classes were used to allow me to access variables from  
 outside the main method 
-The use of polymorphism   
 I used polymorphism to allow me to collect the users input through KeyListener.  
 This is done through implements and extends  
-Constructor methods  
 Constructors were used in all classes which made my code more readable and easy to follow
